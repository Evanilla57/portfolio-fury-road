                <p>My name is Evan Griggs and I am soon to be a graduate of UCR Extension's Coding Bootcamp. As a full-stack web developer, I continue to hone my skills in
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, and NoSQL Databases. Thank you for joining me along this journey. I look forward to sharing many more exciting
                    projects to come!</p>
